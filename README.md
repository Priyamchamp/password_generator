# Password Generator

A simple command-line tool for generating and checking password strength.

## Installation

You can install the password generator package using pip:

```bash
pip install password-generator
```

## Usage

To generate a password, use the following command:

```bash
password-generator --length 16 --numbers --letters --special-chars --copy
```

Replace `--length 16` with the desired password length. You can also include or exclude numbers (`--numbers`), letters (`--letters`), and special characters (`--special-chars`) as needed.

The generated password will be displayed, and if the `--copy` option is specified, it will also be copied to the clipboard.
